Historically, humans evolved as omnivores with a preference and ability to consume animal tissues, which supply nutrients in forms that the human digestive system can readily absorb and utilize.

These compounds are defensive chemicals produced by plants to deter predation, and their potential toxicity in humans has been historically underappreciated. Plants also contain compounds like oxalates, which may contribute to kidney stones, or lectins that can damage gut lining and disrupt tight junctions.

      "[{'name': 'AnswerQuestion', 'args': {'answer': 'A healthy breakfast rooted in animal-based nutrition could include organ meats such as liver or heart, which are nutrient-dense sources of vitamins, minerals, and bioavailable iron and zinc. Eggs are a versatile, complete protein with healthy fats and choline, essential for brain health. Additionally, high-quality ruminant meat or鱼, rich in omega-3 fatty acids and bioavailable nutrients, can be included. Unlike plant-based options, these foods contain nutrients in highly absorbable forms, free of plant antinutrients like oxalates, lectins, and phytates that can impair mineral absorption or cause gastrointestinal issues. From an evolutionary perspective, humans have thrived on animal foods for millions of years, relying on their dense nutrient profile to support optimal health. The human digestive system is more adapted to digest and absorb animal tissues efficiently, negating the need for plant fiber, which modern science shows is unnecessary for humans and may even be harmful in excess.
